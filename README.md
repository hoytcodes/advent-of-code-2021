# 🌊 Advent of Code 2021
Solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge for December 2021. This years solutions are written in JavaScript and run in the console via Node.js. It probably won't be the most elegant code, but data processing isn't my strong point.

## 🏆 Goals
* Complete at least 5 days, both parts
* Learn more about array methods
